# Telegram Bot
A Telegram bot written in Golang that aggregates content from Reddit. Used largely for keeping Go skills up to speed. Initially modeled after https://github.com/masnun/telegram-bot

## Objective
Establish functionality to retrieve posts from Reddit and send them via Telegram. Once this functionality exists, the specific posts and potentially way of delivering can be improved.
